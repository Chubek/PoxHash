# PoxHash Contributions

This directory belongs to contributed implementions to the PoxHash project. Please submit your finalized code in this directory through a pull request.

## Code of Condut

1- You are free to contribute in any coding language, even the ones that already have implementations in the top-level directory.

2- Try your best to submit a finalized code.

3- Submit your code inside a subdirectory with the following format:

```
<language>-<paradigm>-<contributor name>
``` 

Paradigm must be the dominant paradigm used in coding of the hash. For example functional, OOP, etc. Please use your Github user name as the contributor name.

4- The final code has to produce the same hexdigest has the code in the top-level directory. You ar allowed to do it by other means. You are allowed to make as many innovations and optimizations as possible.

5- Every piece of code must be submitted with an example with the name `example.<extention>`. If the language used disallows that, please contact me on Discord.

6- Try to make your code portable as possible, as per the codes in top-level directory.

7- The interface for communicating with your code is optional. But you must provide an apt interface, be it a class or function.

8- If your interface is a class, it must be named `PoxHash`. If your interface is a function it must be named `pox_hash` or `poxHash`. Language naming rules apply.

9- Please do not export anything from your code except the interface, if possible.

10- You can always submit a pull request for your own code, but not others' code.
