# PoxHash: A Block Hash Algorithm

PoxHash is a block hash algorithm that I came up with. It focuses on universality and irreversibility rather than speed. The algorithm is made up of several intricate bitwise operations that scramble the message into a final 64bit hash digest. The current implementations offer this digest in 7 non-decimal and 4 decimal digests. This algorithm is released u
